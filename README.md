# Daily Python & DSA Practice

Welcome to my **daily coding practice** repo! I'm committed to sharpening my programming and problem-solving skills by consistently working on **Python** concepts and **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**.

This repository is my personal log to track progress, reflect on learnings, and maintain discipline as I grow as a developer and problem solver.

---

## Goal

Practice coding every day — even if it's just a small concept or one problem — and track it here. The goal is **progress, not perfection**.

---

## Folder Structure



coding-practice/
├── python/        # Python syntax, small projects, language concepts
│   └── day\_XX/    # Daily Python practice
├── dsa/           # Data Structures & Algorithms practice
│   └── day\_XX/    # Daily DSA problems
└── progress.md    # Optional daily tracker



Each `day_XX` folder contains:
- One or more `.py` files (problems or concepts practiced)
- A `notes.md` file with thoughts, learnings, or errors encountered

---

## Tools & Platforms

- **Python 3.10+**
- **LeetCode**, **HackerRank**, **Codeforces**, etc.
- **VSCode / Jupyter Notebooks**
- Git for version control

## Sample Commit Messages

- `Day 12 - Solved Leetcode 121 (Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock)`
- `Day 20 - Practiced list comprehensions + recursion basics`

---

## Tracking Progress

I maintain a simple log in [`progress.md`](./progress.md) to check off each day's work. This keeps me accountable and motivated.

---

## Why I'm Doing This

- Build coding consistency
- Improve problem-solving patterns
- Prepare for interviews and certifications
- Enjoy learning and challenging myself daily
